    "Distance between left edge of the image and left edge of fisheye view.",

  yBottomOffset:
    "Distance between bottom edge of the image and bottom edge of fisheye view",

  vh:
    "Horizontal view angle (in degrees) of your fisheye lens. Default is 180 degrees.",

    "Vertical view angle (in degrees) of your fisheye lens. Default is 180 degrees.",

    "The HDR image will be resized to this resolution. Default is 1000 pixels.",

  response:
    "A camera response function is the rule that tells your camera how to turn the brightness of a scene into digital pixel numbers.",

  fisheye:
    "The rule a lens uses to map the angles of a real-world scene onto a flat image.",

  vignetting:
    "Vignetting correction fixes the darkening that happens toward the edges of a photo by measuring how much brightness is lost and then brightening those outer areas to match the center. This ensures the image looks evenly lit from center to edge.",

  neutralDensity:
    "Neutral density correction compensates for an ND filter’s dimming and color tint by measuring its effect with a color chart and applying a simple adjustment to restore true brightness and color.",

  calibrationFactor:
    "Photometric calibration takes the real measured brightness and divides it by the HDR image’s calculated brightness to get a correction factor.",

  scaleLimit:
    "The minimum and maximum data values that the color scale covers, determining which values map to the ends of the color gradient.",

  scaleLabel:
    "The text that describes what the colors represent (e.g., “Illuminance (lux)”) and is shown alongside the color bar",

  scaleLevels:
    "The number of discrete color steps or divisions used in the color bar to represent data values.",

  legendDimensions:
    "The width and height (in pixels or units) of the color bar graphic that displays the scale.",
  
  filterImages:
    "Some LDR images do not provide value to the HDR image generation process. Checking this box will filter out those images before generating the HDR"+
    " image. This increases accuracy but also adds a minor increase in the time it takes to finish the generation process.",
