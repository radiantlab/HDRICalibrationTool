/**
 * Explains why the lens mask cannot be cropped out of the image, or returns
 * null when it fits.
 *
 * `crop` cuts out the square circumscribing the mask circle, so the whole
 * square has to lie inside the picture. Radiance is only told about the
 * y axis, and rejects a square that hangs off the top or bottom
 * (`crop.rs`) — but a square hanging off the left or right is not rejected,
 * `pcompos` just pads the missing columns with black. Both are checked here,
 * because both produce a picture the user did not ask for.
 *
 * This runs before the pipeline starts. Without it the y-axis case surfaces
 * from Rust three stages in, after every exposure has already been merged,
 * and the x-axis case never surfaces at all.
